                  Over the past years we have seen that the techniques of designing have improved a lot. Many different people and industries, who have been involved in design, have settled upon a common set of methods for doing human-centred design. Everyone has his or her own favourite method, but all are variants on a common theme expressed through the four stages of: observation, generation, prototyping, and testing (Norman, 1998).
                </p>
                <p>
                  We assume that the basis for the design process will stay similar to what we have now but the way how designers work and collaborate will be changing. Information technologies evolve rapidly and affect the possibilities for development and design. Currently, even if a team of designers is not distributed around the World, it might be much more efficient to interact via the web. This is also the case because nowadays designers operate with a large amount of digital information including a range of types, and exchanging and sharing this information might only be possible only using digital services.

                <p>
                  The problems were revealed during the research where we interviewed designers about their daily routine. I won't go into the details here but highlight main problem statements we identified:
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Tracking support</strong>. Designers find it difficult to track back through what happened during a certain period of time. It is complicated to filter and recall the most relevant information. Designers use multiple sources of information (drawings, pictures, texts, numbers) and tools that are hard to track and structure in a specific moment.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Feedback support</strong>. Designers find it complicated to get feedback from the team or stakeholders on an artefact especially with specific level of details.
                </p>
                <p>
                  <strong>Collaboration support</strong>. Designers find it hard to share their own progress or follow the progress of what other team members are doing when working on the same or related tasks.

                <p>
                  Let's imagine you have a shared folder on Dropbox or Google Drive with some files your colleagues and you share with each other. It can be even well structured with subfolders, file names specifications, etc. But what is it missing? It's very static, it's missing all the events happening around these files.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/alice-folder.png" alt="image of your busy folder should be here" width="100%"/>
                <p>
                  We interviewed designers and based on the feedback we identified key features for the product:
                  <ul class="section__list section__list--dashed">
                    <li>Allow connecting the tool with existing file-sharing services</li>
                    <li>Showing changes in time perspective (a day or a weekâ€™s perspective)</li>
                    <li>Adding category to each file</li>
                    <li>Allow leaving feedback and commenting on each file</li>
                    <li>Easy sharing outside</li>
                    <li>All this in one interface</li>
                  </ul>
                  We visualize files in time perspective, showing the ones that only have been changed during the specific period of time (day, week).
                </p>
                <img src="../images/alice-files.svg"/>
                  <p>
                    Each of these items represents a file and inside of each block a shortcut of a name is placed. This shortcut is a collection of three letters randomly selected from the file name. The height of the each blocks correlates with the amount of revisions over a selected period of time. Some of the items have a bottom part. The bottom blocks show how big a discussion around a file is and the height of this block correlates with the amount of comments. Designers are able to categorize files and map them to specific state of the design process.

                  The prototype we built supported Dropbox. After a designer connected it he or she immediately saw files that were recently added or changed. During the test, it impressed designers because they saw familiar information in a new way. However, there were a lot of points to improve.

                </p>
                <p>
                  After the user testing we transcripted all feedback in <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1XnacgNjWQosgZgsyNM23wzC2Xw93_5vNdEgy54j2ShA/edit?usp=sharing" target="_blank">Google Sheets</a>. Afterward, it was printed and we grouped all the findings into <i>goals</i> and <i>features</i>. The features became a basis for further improvements and new functionality.
