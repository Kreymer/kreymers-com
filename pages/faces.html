                <h5 class="font-point">Initial thoughts</h5>
                <p>
                  Firstly, I tried to immerse into the context of the problem. I closed my eyes and moved 10 years ago when I was a student and one of the teachers came and introduced himself. There were a large group of students, 40-50 people, in front of him and he did not know any single name but from the first moment, he started remembering our faces.
                </p>
                <p>
Some students were memorized after the first lecture, some remained unknown until the final exam. More active students with questions and answers or students that are always coming late and interrupt entire class or the ones that make jokes are all that will be remembered faster.
But why is it happening? Because there is an interaction between a student and a teacher that creates an emotional reaction. It helps to create an association between the image of a person and name and as a result memorizing the name easier.
                </p>
                <p>
That happens not intentionally but what if the teacher wants to ask the person on the last row that is very quiet and almost invisible from 20 meters? This is the problem. When I was a student, teachers pointed to people if they did not know the names but the accuracy of this action was quite low. Students were not sure who is being asked so that’s is the problem for students as well.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div  class="section__point">
                <h5 class="font-point">Understanding the context</h5>
                <p>
                  I wanted to understand better the context. At this point, I assumed that the focus is on <b>University/College level teachers</b>. It helps to narrow down the research to the more specific group but it’s not necessary means that the solution would work only for this type of users.
                </p>
                <p>
                  I found some discussions online where teachers talk about class sizes and interactions between students and teachers during classes. A couple of quotes with interesting insights:
                </p>
                <p><i>"Smaller class sizes are generally perceived as allowing teachers to spend more time with each student and less time in classroom management, thereby providing better instruction tailored to the students’ individual needs, and ensuring higher performance."</i></p>
                <p><i>"I think the optimal number for theory classes should not be higher than 30 students in classroom. A constructive learning requires interaction between professor and students and this interaction can only be fluid when the number of students is not high."</i></p>
                <p>
                  I also tried to figure out how many students are usually present in classes. According to my findings, there are two major types of classes:
                </p>
                <ul class="section__list section__list--dashed">
                  <li><b>Seminar/practical classes</b> - small groups where teacher are able to interact with individuals. (Up to 25 people)</li>
                  <li><b>Lectures</b> - medium groups (up to 50 people) or large groups ( > 50 people)</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In the solution, we will be focusing on small-medium groups because that’s where the teacher might have a need to have a discussion with the students the most and it will require remembering names. In general the smaller group the better it will be to have discussions and understand each of the students. 
                </p>
                <p>
At this point, it’s important to mention that for lectures with a large number of students (> 50 people) teachers don’t need necessary to remember all the names of students because the conversations/open discussions are minimal in this case. </p>
              </div>

               <div  class="section__point">
                <h5 class="font-point">Understanding the problem</h5>
                <p>
                  The second part of the research is looking for existing methods and solutions to remember names. How teachers face the issue and what they already do to solve it. I looked on the websites like Quora, some posts with techniques and forums. I wrote down some interesting quotes and summarized all the findings: 
                </p>
                <p><i>
                  "I draw a simple “map” of the class arrangement, and I write the names as they are sitting. Since usually, students sit in the same places every class, my map is useful until I finally manage to remember the names."
                </i></p>
                <p><i>
                  "Look straight at the child as you say their name, making eye contact, to link the face and the name."
                </i></p>
                <p><i>
                  "Saying the name, marking the roll, looking at the face for an extra moment, always using the name when asking them for something."
                </i></p>
                <p>
                  This research gave me a basis for defining the problem and bunch of ideas to start thinking about possible solutions. One of the teachers suggested that students can actually assist a teacher in remembering  their names. I understood that one of the problems that many students might be not aware of this issue.

                <h5 class="font-point">Problem definition and constraints</h5>
                <p>
                  From the research, I made sure that the problem is huge. Teachers find it absolutely hard to memorize the names. Some of them come up with their own methods and techniques to make it faster.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Several factors make it harder to speed up this process:
                </p>
                <ul class="section__list section__list--numeric">
                  <li><b>Number of students</b>. Number of students appearing at once at the beginning of year/semester makes a huge cognitive load for teachers to remember the names.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><b>Rare meetings related to activities</b>. The underlying problem of remembering the names is that in most cases a teacher meets students weekly and for short period of time (1-2 hours) which is not enough to build strong images of students and create associations with their names.
</li>             <br/>
                  <li><b>Hidden students</b>. Many students don’t create strong associations and remain ‘invisible’ for teachers for long time. These can be quite students, students with ‘hard to remember’ names, etc.</li>
                  <br/>
                  <li><b>Limited dedicated time</b>. Students and a teacher meet during lecture/seminar/other activity which is scheduled to specific time frame and there is no much space for side activities.
</li><br/>
                  <li><b>Students are not aware of this issue</b>. Students might not be aware of this issue otherwise they could help a teacher to remember their names. </li>
                </ul>
                <p class="font-point---original">The solution has to help an educators to match faces with names of <b>large number of students</b>. It should <b>fit to teachers and students activities</b> and do not interrupt or create large additional cognitive load during lectures or other activities with students. The solution should provide opportunity for <b>every student to express uniqueness</b>. Ideally, it should not require <b>lots of dedicated time</b> from a teacher and should assist in <b>remembering the names faster</b>.</p>

                <img src="../images/nf-diagram.jpg" width="49%" style="margin-bottom: 32px; float:left; "/>
                <p>
                  The problem with names is that by itself it does not have a strong connection with a person. Hundreds of years ago our ancestors put the meaning in our last names (at least, in many countries) to associate it with the origin, appearance, activity or any other fact strongly attached to a person. Today as far as we know a person better and better we start associating the name with that person. Many of us have favorite or most unloved names. In most cases, it’s based on the image we built around that name based on our previous experience with people with these names. So, what we need to do here is to help to build this emotional signals faster. 
                </p>
                <p>
                  I went through the things that make people unique. Here is some of it:
                </p>
                <ul class="section__list section__list--dashed">
                  <li>appearance</li>
                  <li>facial expressions</li>
                  <li>origin</li>
                  <li>unique stories</li>
                  <li>character</li>
                  <li>behavior</li>
                  <li>voice</li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                  And here I had an idea. Some teachers mentioned that it’s efficient to have eye contact and hear students, more interactions lead to a faster process of memorizing students. We know that the problem that teachers don’t meet students that much outside of classrooms, so why not make it virtual? What if ask students to record a selfie-video where they pronounce their name and tell unique fact? In this case, we will reproduce real-life scenario adding appearance, voice, facial expressions and maybe a bit of understanding the character of a student. Indeed, in this case, a teacher involves more actively visual and echoic memory by remembering voice and facial expressions.
                </p>
              </div>
              <div  class="section__point">
                <h5 class="font-point">Sketching</h5>
                <p>
                  I started sketching the idea. Actually, after I finished it I had many questions about interactions and other details of the app. How do we explain the idea to students? Should we limit the time for video? Should we have a quiz for a teacher? And more. I solved most of the questions with hypothesis later based on the research and information that I already know.
                </p>
                <img src="../images/nf-sketch.jpg" width="100%" style="margin-bottom: 32px;"/>
                <p>
                  With the general idea of the app and flow in mind, I proceeded with wireframes.
                </p>

                <p><b>Students</b></p>
                In order to be successful, the app requires the right contribution from students. That's why at the beginning I explain the problem and make it clear through the onboarding steps what is required from student:          
                <ul class="section__list section__list--dashed">
                  <li>Full name</li>
                  <li>Gender</li>
                  <li>Group on university/collge level (if applicable)</li>
                  <li>First name (short name)</li>
                  <li>Video</li>
                </ul>     
                <p>
                During onboarding, I also provide samples of videos with tips how to make the right selfie. When students complete registration they will be able to edit own video and see intros from teachers and classmates. These features are secondary but they are needed to drive students to register. And it's also fun.
                </p>

                <p><b>Teachers</b></p>
                <p>
                  Teachers use the same app but they have a different entry. The main screen is the dashboard with 2 sections:
                </p>
                <ul class="section__list section__list--dashed">
                  <li><b>Meet new students</b>. Quick overview of new (unseen for a teacher) students.</li>
                  <li><b>Practice</b>. Series of quizzes to practice with names of students.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Students onboarding step and teacher dashboard were completed in high fidelity. These two experiences are essential in the concept and required extra effort to complete.</p>

When a user clicks on the photo selfie-video starts playing. The next video will play automatically and it will continious until the end of the list or until a teacher would stop playback. The notification will be send whe 15 new students appear so a teacher would not need to spend a lot of time to meet everyone and would meet students by small groups.

                    A teacher can practice names with quizzes. Students can be combined by groups or classes. When a user selects 'Random selection' from all the students he will get the ones he never practiced or the ones where mistakes took a place.

                  A teacher can go through the videos and meet students. There is a label with the student name in each video in case if a teacher does not have an opportunity to listen.

                  <p>
                  When a teacher goes through the quiz the video is not played and two options to answer are given. Whether the answer is right or wrong the video will start playing right after the answer is given. With a colored overlay, I additionally communicate if the answer is right or wrong.

                  <p>
                    To reinforce the right answer and exclude the case when a teacher just guessed right one out of two. The only difference is that when the right answer is given video might be skipped. A quiz might be based on next lesson or lecture (it will require integration with calendar or schedule system).

                  <p class=" font-intro">Results</p>
                  After every quiz, a teacher can see the score, the accuracy of remembering names. The screen communicates the result and gives feedback about the score. A teacher is able to practice again with videos from students that created difficulties with remembering names.

                  As the next steps, I would do concept testing to validate the ideas I come up with. I would also do usability testing to understand if the interface and main actions are clear to users. Probably It will reveal a lot of improvements and will allow iterating. Ideally, it would be great to test the concept in pilot college or university with a couple of teachers.

                  The provided solution should help a teacher to associate names with faces faster. The solution meets all the requirements I revealed in the problem definition.

                  <li>A teacher will regularly get notifications with newly registered students. A teacher can start remembering students by small groups avoiding large number at once via selfie-videos.</li>
                  <li>Now teacher and students can introduce each other outside of classroom and not limited to 1-2 hours per week.</li>
                  <li>The app is available to all students and allows express yourself to everyone.</li>
                  <li>The app will require a little dedicated time and could be easily fit during the day or in the evenings.</li>
                  <li>The solution is based on best practices from teachers and should allow them to remember names and faces faster.</li>
